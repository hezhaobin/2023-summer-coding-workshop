Gresham and colleagues performed a genome-wide screen for single gene deletion mutants that have a significantly different half-life (death rate) under nutrient starvation. Using pooled sequencing of unique barcodes, they estimated the relative abundance of each mutant strain over 500 hours of incubation. From the data, they inferred the death rate and calculated from it the half-life for each strain under either phosphate or leucine starvation. The model gave both the point estimates and also a p-value for each gene against the null hypothesis that the gene had no effect on death rate. Our goal is to reproduce the GO term enrichment analysis and also a related but different analyses, where they compared the half-life of pre-defined gene sets against other genes to test specific hypotheses, e.g., whether mitochondrial genes are enriched among those that decreased the half-life when deleted.
